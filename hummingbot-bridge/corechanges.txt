Perfect! Let me give you a complete summary:

  üìã Summary of Changes - Core vs Strategy

  ‚úÖ NEW Core Hummingbot Code Added (Untracked files - need to be committed):

  1. /home/todd/PycharmProjects/hummingbot/hummingbot/connector/gateway/core/ (NEW DIRECTORY)
  - gateway_network_adapter.py (NEW FILE - 125 lines)
  - __init__.py (NEW FILE - empty module file)

  Purpose: The GatewayNetworkAdapter class enables dynamic network switching for Gateway connectors without requiring separate connector instances per network.

  üìù Strategy File Changes (Your script):

  1. /home/todd/PycharmProjects/hummingbot/scripts/mqtt_webhook_strategy_w_cex.py
  - Modified _get_dex_connector() method (lines 257-308):
    - Added import: from hummingbot.connector.gateway.core.gateway_network_adapter import GatewayNetworkAdapter
    - Now wraps connectors with GatewayNetworkAdapter
    - Passes network parameter to the adapter
  - Removed obsolete methods (you did this manually):
    - _get_chain_for_network()
    - _verify_solana_transaction()
    - _get_token_decimals()
  - Removed obsolete attribute:
    - self._network_connectors cache

  üîß Other Modified Files (Pre-existing, not part of this feature):

  - hummingbot/core/gateway/gateway_http_client.py (Modified - from previous work)
  - hummingbot/data_feed/coin_gecko_data_feed/coin_gecko_constants.py (Modified - from previous work)
  - scripts/amm_trade_example.py (Modified - from previous work)

  üéØ Answer to Your Question:

  For this latest multi-network switching feature:

  ‚úÖ Core Hummingbot code changes:
  - 1 new directory: hummingbot/connector/gateway/core/
  - 2 new files: gateway_network_adapter.py + __init__.py
  - Total: ~130 lines of new core code

  ‚úÖ Strategy file changes:
  - 1 modified method: _get_dex_connector()
  - 1 new import: GatewayNetworkAdapter
  - Removed ~100 lines of obsolete code
  - Total: ~20 lines of changes, ~100 lines removed

  üì¶ To Make This Portable/Reusable:

  If you want to use this multi-network feature in other strategies or share it, you need to:

  1. Commit the core code to your Hummingbot repository:
  git add hummingbot/connector/gateway/core/
  git commit -m "(feat) add GatewayNetworkAdapter for dynamic network switching"

  2. Any new strategy can then use it by:
  from hummingbot.connector.gateway.core.gateway_network_adapter import GatewayNetworkAdapter

  # Wrap any Gateway connector
  adapter = GatewayNetworkAdapter(connector, network="base")

  The core adapter code is reusable and framework-level, while your strategy just uses it! üéâ
